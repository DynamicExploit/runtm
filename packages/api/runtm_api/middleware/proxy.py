"""Trusted proxy middleware and utilities.

SECURITY: This module provides centralized logic for trusting forwarded headers.
Only requests from trusted proxy IPs will have X-Forwarded-* headers honored.

This prevents:
- IP spoofing via X-Forwarded-For from direct connections
- TLS spoofing via X-Forwarded-Proto from untrusted sources
- Rate limit bypass via header manipulation

Usage:
    # Get client IP (only trusts headers from proxies)
    ip = get_client_ip(request, settings)

    # Check TLS status (only trusts X-Forwarded-Proto from proxies)
    scheme = get_request_scheme(request, settings)

    # Middleware for TLS enforcement
    app.add_middleware(TLSEnforcementMiddleware, settings=settings)
