Sandboxes where coding agents build and deploy.

Spin up isolated environments where Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and other agents code and ship software. With live URLs, logs, and previews.

```bash
runtm init
runtm deploy
```

## Why Runtm?

AI coding agents like Claude Code and Cursor are powerful—but they need a place to run. Runtm gives them:

- **Isolated sandboxes** – Agents code with full permissions without touching your machine
- **Real URLs** – Deploy to live HTTPS endpoints instantly
- **Logs and previews** – See what your agent built, debug issues, iterate fast
- **Works with any agent** – Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, and more

## How it works

```mermaid

    style Agent fill:#f4f4f5,stroke:#18181b,stroke-width:2px,color:#18181b
    style Sandbox fill:#f4f4f5,stroke:#18181b,stroke-width:2px,color:#18181b
    style Runtm fill:#f4f4f5,stroke:#18181b,stroke-width:2px,color:#18181b
    style URL fill:#18181b,stroke:#18181b,stroke-width:2px,color:#fafafa
```

1. **Spin up a sandbox** – Your agent gets an isolated workspace
2. **Agent builds** – Full permissions to code, install deps, run tests
3. **Deploy** – One command to a real URL with logs and previews
4. **Iterate** – Agent sees logs, fixes bugs, redeploys

## What you can build

Agents can build and deploy any web software:

- APIs and webhooks
- Dashboards and admin panels
- Landing pages and docs
- Automations and agent backends
- Full-stack web apps

<Info>
Runtm is **bring-your-own-cloud**. We start with Fly.io as the default provider, with AWS and GCP support coming soon.
</Info>

## Cloud providers

| Provider | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Fly.io | Available now |
| AWS | Coming soon |
| GCP | Coming soon |

<Note>
Self-hosters can implement custom providers using the provider interface.
</Note>

## Guardrails

Runtm enforces sensible limits by default:

| Constraint | Limit |
|------------|-------|
| Artifact size | 20 MB |
| Build timeout | 10 minutes |
| Deploy timeout | 5 minutes |
| Rate limit | 10 deploys/hour |
