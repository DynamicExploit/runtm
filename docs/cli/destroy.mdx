# runtm destroy

Stop and remove a deployment, freeing all resources.

```bash
runtm destroy <deployment_id>
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `deployment_id` | Yes | Deployment ID to destroy |

## Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--force` | `-f` | Skip confirmation prompt |

## Examples

```bash
# Destroy with confirmation
runtm destroy dep_abc123xyz

# Skip confirmation
runtm destroy dep_abc123xyz --force
```

## What Gets Destroyed

- **Machine** - Fly.io machine is stopped and removed
- **DNS** - Custom domain records are cleaned up
- **State** - Deployment marked as `destroyed`

<Note>
  Destroying a deployment does **not** delete:
  - Build logs (kept for audit)
  - Previous version records
  - Your local source code
</Note>

## Confirmation

By default, you'll be asked to confirm:

```
Destroy deployment dep_abc123xyz?

  Name:     my-api
  Status:   ● ready
  URL:      https://my-api-xyz.fly.dev

  This will:
  • Stop and remove the machine
  • Delete custom domain configuration
  • Make the URL unavailable

Continue? [y/N]: 
```

Skip with `--force`:

```bash
runtm destroy dep_abc123xyz --force
```

## Destroyable States

You can destroy deployments in these states:

| State | Destroyable |
|-------|-------------|
| `queued` | ✓ Yes |
| `building` | ✗ No (wait for build to complete/fail) |
| `deploying` | ✗ No (wait for deploy to complete/fail) |
| `ready` | ✓ Yes |
| `failed` | ✓ Yes |
| `destroyed` | ✗ Already destroyed |

## After Destruction

```
✓ Deployment dep_abc123xyz destroyed

  The URL https://my-api-xyz.fly.dev is no longer available.

  To redeploy, run: runtm deploy
```

If you deploy again with the same project name, a **new** deployment will be created with a new URL.
