## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- A [Runtm account](https://app.runtm.com)

## Install the CLI

<CodeGroup>

```bash uv (recommended)
uv tool install runtm
```

```bash pipx
pipx install runtm
```

```bash pip
pip install runtm
```

</CodeGroup>

Verify installation:

```bash
runtm version
```

## Spin up a sandbox

```bash
runtm init
```

This creates an isolated workspace for your agent to build in. You'll be prompted to authenticate if you haven't already.

<Tip>
Start from scratch or pick a template—your agent can build anything.
</Tip>

## Test locally

```bash
runtm run
```

The CLI detects your runtime and starts the right dev server.

## Deploy

```bash
runtm deploy
```

First deploy takes 2-3 minutes. Subsequent deploys are faster.

✓ Validated project
✓ Created artifact (2.1 MB)
✓ Building...
✓ Deploying...

🚀 Deployed!

   URL: https://my-app-xyz123.fly.dev
   ID:  dep_abc123xyz
```

## View logs

```bash
runtm logs dep_abc123xyz
```

Filter by type:

```bash
runtm logs dep_abc123xyz --type build
runtm logs dep_abc123xyz --type runtime
```

Your agent can use these logs to debug and fix issues.
