Why this split?

The server components (API and Worker) are licensed under AGPLv3 to ensure that
improvements to hosted deployments remain open source. This follows the pattern
used by Grafana, MinIO, and other open-core projects.

The CLI and shared libraries are Apache-2.0 licensed for maximum adoption and
ease of integration.

Templates are MIT licensed with zero friction for users to build upon.

For specific license terms, see the LICENSE file in each package directory.
